# CMS-global-pool-monitor

This is a set of simple monitoring scripts that run queries to the CMS HTCondor global pool, then plot results via google charts scripts in HTML files

/queries: query shell scripts, plus a few python ones (calculate averages, parse gWMS FE xml, etc) 

/make_html: scripts that build the html files that present the plots with the accumulated data
